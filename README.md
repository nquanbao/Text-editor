# Text Editor     ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

- What was your motivation?
    
    To build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria.
    This app also creates notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so I can reliably retrieve them for later use

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    
    For weekly assignment

- What did you learn?
    
    learn more about PWA, such as webpack, running client and server same time, and also learn more some window DOM like service worker, manifest and IndexDB
